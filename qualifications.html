            <h1>Technical Skills</h1> <br>
            <p>My education at Texas A&M University has trained my technical skills in software and hardware engineering and allowed me to delve deeper 
            in my interest to the software development life cycle. In my computer science courses, such as Data Structures and Algorithms, Computer Architecture and Design, 
            and Programming Languages, I have completed many labs involving the use of C++, Java, Bash, and Python. I worked extensively coding C++ in a Linux environment in my last spring semester,
            which had prepared me to interview and accept a position as a DevOps intern at Arthrex California Technology this past summer. I got to increase my skills specifically in the mainstream 
            scripting languages, Python and Bash, to be able to create scripts to automate processes. My mentor and supervisor helped me learn how to containerize software in Docker by creating Dockerfiles for source code and 3rd party libraries. I also then gained 
              foundational knowledge on how to setup a CI/CD pipeline both in Atlassian BitBucket and CircleCI by learning how to format and create “.yaml” configuration files. All the projects that I 
              worked on at my internship allowed me to see the importance of other tools that are used among software teams that might not be considered software used for developing, or coding. Continuously 
              building code, as well as continuously testing, helps to increase the rate of delivering what development teams produce. I understand the bigger picture on how source code can turn into a fully 
              functioning product in the production environment, especially with how they might be deployed using Amazon Web Services. Being a part of a software team also exposed me to Atlassian JIRA, which 
              is a tool that taught me how to work under Agile project management. I see the value in frequent and efficient communication with other teams in a software sector. My exposure to DevOps is just 
              the starting point on my curiosity of automation and cloud tools. Thankfully this senior year, I have been able to create full stack applications, both web and local. I have deployed an application to 
            AWS myself involving EC2, RDS, Jenkins, and Docker. My portfolio projects have exhibited these efforts and I am free to talk about them!</p>

            <p class="lead"> <br>
              After my TechOps internship at Arthrex, I became more familiar in the necessity and importance of DevOps roles in software departments. Automation is something that
              I am passionate about, because saving time is the key to reaching goals in an efficient, but speedy way. In the future, I plan to get my AWS Certified Cloud Practioner certification, and then 
              a CompTIA Network+ certification. I want to become more accumulated with managing software company's affiliation with cloud services such as AWS, and then also help to push code to production using
              CI/CD and configuration management. I am also avid in being involved in development, as coding is a passion of mine. I love being knowledgeable of both ends, development and production. My goal is to become
             increasingly familiar with more front end and back end frameworks, so that I can create any project I set my mind too, as well as understand how to deploy them successfuly.</p>
